# Random Mouse Movement
This program moves the mouse cursor to random positions within a defined area and sends a key press signal to the computer at a random time interval. It uses the pyautogui module to control the mouse and keyboard, random module to generate random values, time module to wait for a random amount of time and keyboard module to simulate a key press.

## Installation
Before running the program, make sure that you have installed the required modules. You can install them using pip:
```
pip install pyautogui
```
## Usage
To run the program, open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the script is located, and run the following command:
```
python mouseauto.py
```
While the program is running, the mouse cursor will move randomly within a defined area on the screen, and a key press signal will be sent at random time intervals. The area is defined by setting the x_min, y_min, x_max, and y_max variables, which can be adjusted to fit your screen size or desired area.

To exit the program, press the "Q" key on your keyboard.
